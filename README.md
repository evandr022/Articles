## Abstract

5G networks emerge as a solution for many cellular mobile communication scenarios, demanding new energy consumption requirements. Diverse approaches regarding the base station (BS) have already been discussed in the literature, but little has been debated about the user equipment (UE). In this paper, the objective is to understand in practice how much propagation channels subject to multi-path fading can influence the battery consumption of mobile devices connected to a 5G network. Considering an emulated network in the laboratory, 3GPP NLOS TDL channel models and conditions with different resources allocation are analyzed. Results have shown that the poorquality channel requires more power from the battery due to a more complex process for demodulating the degraded Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH) signal and more energy for sending uploading content related to the Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH). Furthermore, fading profiles with longer delays proved to be higher energy consumers.
